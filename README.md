#ES6 Project
*This project is not public, so I can't share the link*

####Introduction

This is the code required to power an amount spent calculator. Essentially, the calculator determines how much money has been spent since January 1st on a category of products. The calculator will also take into consideration whether or not the current year is a leap year. This project uses the ES6 syntax. I prefer to use standard string declaration instead of the ES6 form, unless I am needing to use string interpolation.

The "beta" information that you will see in the code is in reference to signing up for the newsletter on the website, that would put the user into the beta test for the product.
